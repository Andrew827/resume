            <p>
                I am a second-year university student looking to pursue a new career in software engineering. I find myself to be a mature hardworking individual seeking new and interesting challenges. During my personal and academic development, I have gained the ability to challenge myself and operate well under pressure. I am looking for an exciting new opportunity to be a part of a new team developing innovative technologies, and providing exceptional software held to a professional standard.
